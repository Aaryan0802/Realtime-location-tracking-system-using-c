Developing a real-time location tracking system using C , NodeMCU and Neo-6M GPS module.Description: ESP8266 and NEO-6M GPS Tracking System
This code is designed to create a real-time GPS tracking system using an ESP8266 microcontroller and a NEO-6M GPS module. It reads location data (latitude, longitude), date, and time from the GPS module, processes it using the TinyGPS++ library, and hosts a user-friendly web page on a local server to display the data. The project provides an interactive way to visualize location coordinates and open them directly in Google Maps.

Features
Real-Time GPS Data:

Retrieves accurate latitude, longitude, date, and time from the NEO-6M GPS module.
Converts UTC to local time for better usability.
Embedded Web Server:

ESP8266 acts as a Wi-Fi server, allowing access to the GPS data via a browser.
Displays data in a styled HTML format, ensuring clarity and readability.
Google Maps Integration:

Provides a clickable link to view the current GPS location in Google Maps.
Responsive HTML Interface:

Includes a well-designed, responsive table to present the data attractively.
Styled with CSS for better user experience and modern aesthetics.
Workflow
Data Capture: The GPS module sends raw NMEA sentences containing satellite data.
Data Parsing: TinyGPS++ processes the NMEA sentences to extract the required fields.
Wi-Fi Connection: ESP8266 connects to the specified Wi-Fi network and hosts a local server.
Data Presentation: The web server displays the processed data on a modern HTML interface.
Interactive Mapping: Users can click a link to open the location on Google Maps.
Applications
Personal or vehicle tracking.
Real-time GPS monitoring for IoT projects.
Outdoor navigation and geolocation services.
This code is a practical example of integrating GPS technology with IoT, providing a solid foundation for more complex tracking systems.
